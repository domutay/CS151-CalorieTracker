# High-level description:

### Plan: (Subject to change)
For the front end, we will be using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. For the back end, we will be using various API’s and primarily working in Java(springboot or thymeleaf). We will also be using MongoDB/sql for our database. Work will be divided by features among the members. We are all full-stack developers and will be working on both frontend and backend for each of the features assigned to us and merge each together as we implement them. To start, each separate feature that we work on will be handled in a separate page and most likely combined into a single page once we get everything working. We will have soft deadlines for the features based on cycles and change the workload as needed for more intensive features. 

### Functionality: How our solution tackles the issues?
This solution will tackle all of the issues in one central place. The application will allow a person to easily keep track of their calories by calculating the calories they have consumed each day based on their food input. On top of providing recommendations for foods, the app will also provide recipes for their recommendations, giving users a personal experience and an opportunity to make the dishes themselves. The app will also contain a feature where users can track their daily nutritional intake based on the foods they have eaten, providing an extra layer of personalization that helps them visualize the healthiness of the food they eat. 

### Operations: Expected User operations
### User:
* Create account
* Add in favorite foods and recipes
* Input food eaten for the day
* List allergies/dislikes (to avoid food referrals)
* Create a calorie count goal
* Get recipe for dishes

# Admin (?):
* Add new recipes
